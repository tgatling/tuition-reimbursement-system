# Tuition Reimbursement Management System
This is a system designed to help manage a company's tuition reimbursement program.
It allows employees to apply for reimbursement for particular events that will aid 
them in their career.  These events include university courses, seminars, certifications
preparation classes, certifications, and technical training.  After the submission 
of an reimbursement form and any supporting documents, the form will be review by a 
supervisor, department head, and the benefits coordinator for review.  If  the 
reimbursement is approved in all stages, the employee must then submit evidence
of completion with a passing grade or presentation.  After review, reimbursement
is then granted or denied.
