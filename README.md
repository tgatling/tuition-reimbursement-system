# Tuition Reimbursement Management System
This is a tuition reimbursement system for employees who wish to expand their 
knowledge as it is relevant to their expertise.  The system allows employees
to apply for reimbursement for university courses, seminars, certifications prep
classes, certifications, and technical training.  After the submission of an
reimbursement form and any supporting documents, the form will be review by a 
supervisor, department head, and the benefits coordinator for review.  If  the 
reimbursement is approved in all stages, the employee must then submit evidence
of completion with a passing grade or presentation.  After review, reimbursement
is then granted or denied.
